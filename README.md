Spotify Clone
Created a clone of the discovery page from Spotify. I used the Spotify for Developers API to allow access to my account. Authentication is run through them and I was able to display my Discovery Playlist. I Utilized Context API to share states across all of the components.

Things to work on:
Adding music playback functionality and adding volume adjustments as well as skip songs
